# Kmeans-Clustering
Kmeans clustering Algorithms in C++

Given a list of 2-D points, and a cluster number, K, the task is to partition the input point set to K clusters such that all points within one cluster are closer to the centroid of their own cluster (in distance) than to the centroids of all other clusters. 

<b>How to run</b>.

This code runs from the command line and requires the following arguments from command line upon running

argv[1]: inFile.txt
argv[2]: the number of clustering groups
argv[3]: outFile1.txt is created when specified and it will display the 2d results after each iteration
argv[4]: outFile2.txt is created when specified and it will display each point and what centroid it will belong to (closest to) after each iteration
